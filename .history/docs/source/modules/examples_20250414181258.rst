Examples
========


In this section, we provide a collection of examples that demonstrate the capabilities of the WavePropError package.

These examples cover both monochromatic and irregular wave propagation and serve as practical guides for running the wave model using different numerical schemes. They also showcase how to:

- Configure and run simulations with various numerical schemes.
- Extract and visualize the full numerical solution across the whole domain.
- Extract and visualize time series at specific positions in the domain.
- Compare the results against exact solutions.
- Compute and analyze the dispersive and diffusive errors introduced by different numerical schemes.

The examples are provided as interactive Jupyter notebooks and static HTML previews. Users can either view them directly in the browser or run them locally to explore the effects of different settings more interactively.
